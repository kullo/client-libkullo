libkullo
========

A platform-independent C++ client library for the Kullo protocol.

Configuring Qt Creator for development
--------------------------------------

Open `libkullo/CMakeLists.txt` in Qt Creator. Next, you should configure both a debug and a release build.

### Debug build

* Build configuration name: `Debug`
* Build path: `build-libkullo-debug`
* Make: Select target `install`, additional args should be `-j4` (or whatever you prefer)
* When asked to run CMake, run without args

### Release build

* Build configuration name: `Release`
* Build path: `build-libkullo`
* Make: same as for the debug build
* When asked to run CMake, run with arg `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release`
    * CMake stores this setting in its cache file which is located in the build dir. Thus, setting the build type is only necessary when the build dir doesn't exist yet or is empty.

Testing
-------

* From Qt Creator: Run the `libkullo_tests` target
* From command line: cd to build dir, run `make test` or `ctest`

Measuring test coverage
-----------------------

* Ubuntu/Fedora: install `lcov`
* Copy `coverage_settings.sample` to `coverage_settings` and edit it
* Run the `coverage.sh` script

Generating docs
---------------

* Install `doxygen` and `graphviz`
* Run `doxygen` from the main directory (containing `Doxyfile`)

Tips and Tricks
---------------

### Speed up Make
* Add make command line option `-j N` to use N parallel build processes

### Speed up g++ through ccache
* Install `ccache`
* Linux: Add `"QMAKE_CXX=ccache g++"` to the qmake arguments in the project build settings

### Checking -mmacosx-min-version/MACOSX\_DEPLOYMENT\_TARGET
`otool -l example.dylib | grep -A3 LC_VERSION_MIN_MACOSX`
